# Foldit usage report

Through the Foldit game, I was able to learn and reinforce what I had learned in class about tertiary and quaternary structures. It is a great game that helps you understand various things related to how proteins fold, such as the importance of hydrogen bonds in preserving protein structure, and the hydrophobic amino acid residues that prefer to be “locked” inside the protein to avoid interaction with the water molecules with which they normally share space. 

In addition to the importance of the protein being compact to avoid voids where water molecules destabilize the hydrophobic cores, the protein backbone and side chains should not be too close together because otherwise the electrostatic interactions of the atoms would repel each other. 

I feel that this is a great way to understand structures in a more interactive way. I remember the first time I saw a 3D structure of a protein, and I found it somewhat difficult to understand how structures such as alpha-helices and beta-folds are located, even later when we began to see domains such as beta-barrels. I feel that it is a great way to observe and understand why proteins have the shapes they do and are not random.

On the other hand, I loved the tips and information provided about proteins. The game not only encourages you to optimize the structure, but also finds ways to introduce small pieces of important information.

Similarly, I would have liked to see chaperones included in some way, as they are necessary in certain contexts for the correct folding of proteins.
