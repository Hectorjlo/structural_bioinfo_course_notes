# Documentation for the tools used

The tool reviewed this day was the game "Foldit", with the knowledge adquired in the class.

In the game it is possible to move the structures that build the proteins like:
- Side chains
- $\beta$-sheets
- $\alpha$ helixes

And the interactions and propities of that structures, like hydrofobic side chains, hydrophilic residues, hydrogen bonds between $\beta$-sheets, and how most of the proteins are tightly packed.

In the [`pictures`](./pictures/) folder there are some snapshots of the game.
